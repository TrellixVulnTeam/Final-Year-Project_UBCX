        <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">The goal of this project is to explore automated tools for retrieving data from statistical websites to increase the research abilities of epidemiologists all over the world.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">These are the statistical websites which act as the main point of reference for this tool:</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"><a
                    href="http://new.who.int/">World Health Organisation</a></span></li>
            <li style="line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif;"><a

        <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">Its immediate goal was to support a PhD which is attempting to predict a person&rsquo;s risk of acquiring an infectious disease. However, as well as providing access to the data necessary for that project, this F.Y.P. also constructs an argument to create the most viable way to acquire the statistics needed for epidemiologists (among others), as well as outlining the computational barriers one would need to overcome in designing this process.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">We live in a time where some of the most infectious diseases in the world, causing deaths to hundreds of thousands of people each year, can be statistically calculated to reduce a person's risk of acquiring them. The calculated risk of someone catching a disease can be found based on someone&rsquo;s location, the weather there, the time of year, their attributes and the ease at which a disease spreads. All this data can be discovered or retrieved from the sites mentioned above. This data could potentially reduce the number of people becoming infected by providing knowledge on the possibility that they will become infected with a particular type of disease by making personalised and contextualised recommendations.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 6.0pt; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: calibri, sans-serif;">The risk of infectious disease is avoidable if there is an accurate and relevant prediction about the risk of infection. By using Bayesian Networks, which represent data in conditional probability tables, it is possible to calculate this figure. My project is designed to assign data to the marginal probability variables within Bayesian networks to overcome the current limitations of infectious disease risk prediction models.</span></span>
